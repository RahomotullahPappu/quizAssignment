      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Q-01 Difference between of Map,Filter, forEach, find?</h3> <br> 
      <p> <span style="color: brown; font-weight:900;">.map():</span>
        Function .map() is a manipulative function that can modify each element’s content in an array that it is called
        on. This function returns a new array with modified values, the array that it is called on will stay still. This
        function is useful for adding a little change to an already existing array, for example adding a property to an
        object or modifying it. Its construction and use are identical to the previous function .forEach() and both can
        be used interchangeably. </p> <br>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(55, 209, 17); font-weight:900;">.filter():</span>
        Function .filter() is a search function that returns all the elements that fulfil the assigned condition. You
        can search by simple terms, for example, that element is equal to a certain integer, or by more advanced terms,
        for example, searching for an object with certain property that is equal to something. Both examples have a very
        frequent use as a developer.

        This function returns an array of found results, if any, even if only 1 match is found. If a function does not
        find any match, it simply returns an empty array. </p>  <br>

      <p><span style="color: brown; font-weight:900;">.forEach():</span>
        Function .forEach() is another form of just a plain for loop that can be used to iterate through array items.
        This case of a function is used for more complex arrays, for example, an array of objects with a lot of entries
        than just an array of integers.</p>  <br>

      <p><span style="color:  rgb(55, 209, 17); font-weight:900;">.find():</span>
        Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail — this function
        returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first
        that has matched.</p>  <br>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Q-02 Difference between of Local storage, Session storage and Cookies</h3> <br>  

      <p><span style="color: brown; font-weight:900;">Local storage:</span> is the most recent mechanism. It allows for
        larger amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is
        useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. </p>  <br>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(55, 209, 17); font-weight:900;">Session storage:</span> is similar to cookies, but the
        data is only stored for the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the
        browser. Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials. </p>  <br>

      <p><span style="color: brown; font-weight:900;">Cookies:</span> are the oldest and most well-known mechanism. They
        are simple to use and well supported by browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used to
        store data that is not sensitive, such as user preferences.</p> <br> 

      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Q-03 How Does the work of quizTimer?</h3> 
      <p class="py-4"><span style="color: brown; font-weight:900;">quizTimer function:</span> Overall, this function is likely used to display and update a timer on a quiz page, possibly to limit the amount of time a user has to complete the quiz.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Q-04 How Does the work of chooseQuiz ?</h3>

      <p class="py-4"><span style="color: brown; font-weight:900;">chooseQuiz function:</span> Overall, this function appears to be a simple implementation of a quiz-taking feature. However, without knowing the implementation details of the displayAnswers function or the structure of the answers and quizData arrays, it's difficult to fully understand the behavior of this function.
